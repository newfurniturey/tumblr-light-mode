# Tumblr Light Mode

> Tired of dark memes? Lighten up!

Tumblr's aesthetic is a darker blue scheme for all pages on [www.tumblr.com](https://www.tumblr.com/), a decent color
scheme when you're viewing in a low-light or night environment. But what if you prefer a lighter, more bright
appearance?

**Tumblr Light Mode** is a Chrome Extension to provide you with just that!

With this extension enabled, anytime you browse Tumblr from Chrome it will be shown with a much lighter theme!
